# Lesson 11: Implementation
- Poor implementation of a design concept can lead to failure or tragedy
- Determine the the processes, materials, and equipment that will be used in fabrication, assembly, and other manufacturing operations when developing the design concept itself
- Materials chosen for an engineering design must match the performance, environmental, processing, and financial requirements of the product or system
- Design for X (DFX) provides valuable guidelines for developing successful products
- DFX seeks to achieve:
  - Superior, or at least satisfactory, performance of all design functions
  - Minimum costs, maintenance, and repair
  - High levels of quality and reliability
  - Fastest time to market
  - Fundamentally safe products and processes
  - Designs that can be updated and upgraded as necessary
- Apply basic principles and general guidelines for effective fabrication
- Consider important aspects of packaging
