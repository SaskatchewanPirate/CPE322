# Lesson 8: Ethics and Product Liability
- Codes of ethics provide guidelines for dealing with various types of professional dilemmas
- The ancient code of Hammurabi for builders and the United States marine safety code are early guidelines for acceptable engineering practice
- Professional engineers must follow specific legal obligations and requirements
- The NSPE Code of Ethics can be helpful if one is confronted by an ethical choice or dilemma
- Design engineers must be familiar with product liability law to understand the legal boundaries for socially acceptable products
- Manufacturing defects in a product is localized to a single unit, whereas warning and design defects affect the entire product population
- Negligence, strict liability and implied warranty, and express warranty and misrepresentation are the three major categories of product liability lawsuits
- Privity no longer serves to protect manufacturers from lawsuits
- One must design against foreseeable uses and misuses of a product
- Possible changes in a product during its useful lifetime must be anticipated in the design process
