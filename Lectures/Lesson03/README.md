# Lesson 3: Structuring the Search for the Problem
- Technical problems can be classified into three basic categories: problems of prediction, problems of explanation, and problems of invention (or some combination thereof)
- Incorrect formulation of a problem may result in a final design that is of little value or that may even be hazardous
- Problem statement should focus on the functions to be achieved by the desired design solutions
- Use statement-restatement technique, source/cause approach, revision method, and present state-desired state strategy via Duncker diagrams to define the real problem to be solved
- Perform Kepner-Tregoe situation analysis to evaluate the level of concern/urgency in terms of timing, trend, and impact
- Perform Kepner-Tregoe problem analysis to determine the cause of the problem or subproblem in terms of its characteristics, location, timing, and magnitude by asking both positive and negative questions (what? when? who? where? why? how?)
