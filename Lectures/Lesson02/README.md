# Lesson 2: Needs Assessment
## Design Proposal
A design proposal should answer the following questions that can be used to structure the proposal:  
1. Objective (why?)
2. Background (who? where?)
3. Methodology (how? when?)
4. Expected results (what?)
5. Costs (how much will it cost?)  

The design proposal is a plan that should be concise yet complete.

## Summary
- Engineering designs are intended to satisfy human needs
- Technical problems can be classified into three basic categories: problems of prediction, problems of explanation, and problems of invention (or some combination thereof)
- Success is more likely if one focuses on others and not on oneself
- Design proposals provide the engineer with the opportunity to justify the expenditure of time, money, and effort for a problem-solving project, and to generate an initial plan for completing the project
