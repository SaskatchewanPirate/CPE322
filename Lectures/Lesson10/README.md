# Lesson 10: Design Analysis
- Design evaluation via tools such as decision matrices and the Kepner-Tregoe analysis method can:
  - Prioritize design goals
  - Rank each design alternative in terms of its ability to achieve the desired goals
  - Determine the best solution to the problem
  - Identify the relative strengths and weaknesses including potential hazards of the best design
- Perform Kepner-Tregoe potential problem analysis to compare and contrast the specific risks associated with each of the proposed solutions
- Maintain the highest level of critical objectivity when developing a decision matrix to avoid misleading or incorrect results due to subjectivity
- Carefully estimate costs associated with the design and development of any new device, system, or process
