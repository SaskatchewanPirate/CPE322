# Lesson 7: Synthesis
- Synthesis is the formation of a whole from a set of building blocks or constituent parts, appropriate ways to create a product or system that solves a problem
- There are numerous barriers to creativity, including knowledge, perceptual, emotional, cultural, and expressive barriers
- One must be prepared to transform accidents into design solutions
- Techniques and strategies for stimulating creativity and overcoming barriers to imagination include brainstorming, brainwriting, bionics, checklisting, synectics, analogies, adaptation, fresh perspective, inversion, and idea diagrams
- Use a morphological chart to perform synthesis by joining preliminary ideas or subsolutions together to form total design concepts
