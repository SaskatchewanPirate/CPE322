# Lesson 6: Abstraction and Modeling
- In abstraction, one tries to generate as many different solution categories as possible
- A model is a purposeful representation of a process, object, or system
- Models help organize thoughts, data, and knowledge
- All models are approximations because of simplifying assumptions
- Engineers must be cognizant of all assumptions made in developing the model
- Engineers must determine the resolution (the minimum level of detail) needed in the model for it to properly describe the system under consideration
- A model should never include more than the essential details needed to properly describe a process or system (Occam's razor)
- Models can be abstract or concrete and may be iconic, analogical, or symbolic
- System models can be deterministic or stochastic, whereas process models can be descriptive or prescriptive
- Freehand pictorial, orthographic, and other sketches can be used to describe and develop design concepts
- A wide variety of charts can be used to compare and analyze different kinds of data
