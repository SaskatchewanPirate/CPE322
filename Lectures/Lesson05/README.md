# Lesson 5: Acquiring, Applying, and Protecting Technical Knowledge
- Design engineers must acquire robust (both broad and deep) technical knowledge and develop the ability to apply it whenever necessary 
- There are many sources of valuable technical information with which the engineer should be familiar: manuals, catalogs, books, magazines, journals, and patents
- There are three distinctive types of property: real, personal, and intellectual
- Intellectual property can be protected by trade secret, trademarks, copyrights, or patents
- There are three types of patents: utility, design, and plant
- Criteria used to evaluate utility patent applications include: novelty, usefulness, and nonobviousness
- Engineers and inventors should maintain careful records in anticipation of patent applications
- Patent protection is based on the claims contained in the patent disclosure
