# Lesson 9: Hazards Analysis and Failure Analysis
- Commercial products should be evaluated for hazards such as entrapment, contact/tactile, impact, ejection, entanglement, and noise and vibration
- Root cause analysis (RCA), fault tree analysis (FTA), and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) can be used to enhance the quality and safety of engineering designs
- It is best to eliminate a hazard if at all possible; otherwise, reduce the exposure of the user to the hazard by:
  - Using appropriate guards, sensors, interlocks, and other mechanisms to distance the user from the hazard
  - Increasing the safety factor for the design
  - Using quality assurance efforts, including appropriate tests, to minimize the number of defective units that enter the marketplace
  - Incorporating redundancy into the design
  - The use of warnings that is the least effective approach to hazard reduction and should be used only as a last resort or in combination with other approaches
