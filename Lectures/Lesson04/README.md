# Lesson 4: Structuring the Search for a Solution
- Formulate the desired characteristics or design goals, recognize the constraints within which any solution must lie, and eliminate those paths that will not satisfy these goals and constraints
- Design goals are qualitative, whereas design specifications (specs) are quantitative
- General goals sought in most engineering design solutions include safety, reliability, performance, ease of operation, minimum cost, etc.
- Specific goals that help define the characteristics and desired functions of a particular design include lightweight, water-resistant, transparent, etc.
- Use [anthropometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry), [anatomical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy), [physiological](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiology), and other types of [ergonomic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_factors_and_ergonomics) data and principles to formulate certain types of design specs and to optimize interactions between the design and its users
